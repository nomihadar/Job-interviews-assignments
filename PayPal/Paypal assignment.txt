In an online market place shoppers add items to their virtual cart and later on decide whether to actually purchase them or not.

The challenge we present to you given a driver set containing website visitors, predict whether a visitor will purchase a product (tag == 1) or not (tag == 0).

Attached train and test sets. Each row represents a pair of (website_visitor, product).

Your output should be a text file which contains a single column with the prediction (0 or 1) for each one of the test samples.

Each prediction in the output file should be in a separate row.

Feel free to use any scripting language you find comparable although Python is preferable.

Please consider the test data as an UNSEEN dataset, which is available only for calculating your predictions
 
When you finish, please send me the code as well. Please do NOT publish your code in Git or anywhere else online

Also, please make sure you have a three-hour time window for starting and completing the challenge.
 
Please consider that this home test will be the subject of the first interview as well.

 
Good luck!
